# Lyme-disease-in-the-US

This repository was made for the final project of the Epidemiology III course at the University of Guelph. For this project I conduct a time series analysis of Lyme disease cases in the United states, both by state/locality and total US. The fitted model is then used to forecast Lyme disease cases into 2024 and short-term and long-term trends are investigated.
# Getting Started

This repository is written in R Markdown. 

The pdf file "Lyme_disease_in_the_US.pdf" is a complete write up of the time series analysis, forecasts, and investigations. It also includes a discussion and literature review on the topic. 

The main code can be found as an R Markdown file "Lyme_Notebook.Rmd". This code will take you through a step-by-step process of the explained analysis and model forecasts and will recreate the figures discussed in the "Lyme_disease_in_the_US.pdf" file.


# Acknowledgments 

I would like to give special thanks to Dr. Olaf Berke from the University of Guelph Population Medicine Department for his aid and expertise.
